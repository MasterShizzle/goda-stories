# Go-da Stories

Port of Yoda Stories to Go, based on [an article](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/reverse-engineering-the-binary-data-format-for-star-wars-yoda-stories) about the datafile format

To get started, simply copy the YODESK.DTA file from your Yoda Stories installation into `data/`.

On run, will export tile data and export pngs to `assets/tiles`
